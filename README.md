# FastLog

### **CPU-Optimized Log Processing Engine in C++**

</div>

---

## Overview

**FastLog** is a high-performance C++ application designed to efficiently process massive log files (ranging from 100MB to multiple GBs). It focuses on extreme optimization, leveraging low-level CPU and memory techniques to parse, filter, and analyze data at lightning speeds.

### Key Capabilities
- **High-Speed I/O**: Reads large files efficiently.
- **Parsing**: Extracts structured data from raw log lines.
- **Filtering**: rapid filtering by log level, user ID, or timestamps.
- **Aggregation**: Computes statistics (counts, averages, top-K) in real-time.
- **Optimization**: Implements advanced CPU & memory optimizations.

## Objective

The primary goal is to **progressively optimize** a baseline C++ program. This project serves as a practical exploration of:
- **Memory Management**: Reducing allocations and improving access patterns.
- **CPU Architecture**: Exploiting cache locality and instruction pipelining.
- **Concurrency**: Implementing multithreading for parallel processing.

## Learning Objectives

- **Basic File I/O**: Efficient reading of large datasets.
- **Benchmarking**: Measuring throughput and latency accurately.
- **Memory Optimization**: Custom allocators, zero-copy parsing.
- **CPU Optimization**: Branch prediction, SIMD, cache friendliness.
- **Multithreading**: Thread pools, lock-free structures.
